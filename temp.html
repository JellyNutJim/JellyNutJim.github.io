     <h1>Temporary</h1>
     <pre>
      The website currently has the following features:

      - Display elements in Bohr's model. It should be able to take any element, but currently the possible inputs are only 'Na' and 'Fe'
      - This is because I have not yet created the connection between the database containing all periodic data with the website.
